# Elm-DiMeola

A web app for helping learn (elm)[http://elm-lang.org] and guitar better.

## The Elm Bit

Please note that this is the first thing I have written in elm. Therefore, there
are likely to be anti-patterns, non-optimal ways of doing things, etc. So don't
use this project as any "best practice" example please! That said, it runs and
doesn't look too shabby.

## The Guitar Bit

This project is designed around the book __A Guide to Chords, Scales, &
Arpeggios__ by _Al Di Meola_ and _Bob Aslanian_. The chord shapes and names
are from the study guide laid out in the text. It's a great book (although it
is a bit overwhelming at first) and I'm learning a lot from it!


## Features / TODO:

Things that are done:

- Code to draw chord diagrams
- Ability to pick a chord shape and form and see it

Things I want to do:

- Add all forms up through __X__
- Flashcard mode: pick a form and it will cycle through all the shapes, showing the name for _n_ seconds, then flip to show the diagram.
- Add arpeggio display. Pick a key, it will show you the notes of the arpeggios.
